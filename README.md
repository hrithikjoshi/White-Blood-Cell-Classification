# Task: White Blood Cell Classification

The objective of this task is to train a machine learning model to classify different types of white blood cells (WBCs). The specific types of WBCs to be classified are as follows: bands, basophils, blasts, eosinophils, lymphocytes, metamyelocytes, monocytes, myelocytes, and neutrophils. Data is given in the attachment. Once the model is trained, write a program to utilize the trained model for classifying images stored in the "classify-images" folder into the aforementioned classes.

## Submission Instructions
To submit the task, please follow these steps:

1. Create a public repository on GitHub to host your code and model.
2. Push the code and trained model files to the GitHub repository.
3. Share the URL of the GitHub project with the examiner for evaluation.

## Code Requirements
To ensure a smooth evaluation process, please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. Clean Code: Write clean and well-documented code. Use meaningful variable names and include comments where necessary.
2. Jupyter Notebook: It is preferred to use Jupyter Notebook for showcasing your code. This will allow the examiner to easily understand and follow your work.
3. Mention Training Environment: Specify where the model has been trained. If you trained the model using Colab, Kaggle, your own CPU, or GPU, make sure to mention it. This information will help the examiner replicate your work.

Please make sure to consider these instructions while developing your solution.
